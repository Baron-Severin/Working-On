Commentary:
10-24-16 - On one hand, the proscriptions in Clean Code regarding class length feel a little dogmatic to me, but on the other my tendency has definitely been to write my classes to be overly large. I think I'll give the hyper-short, single responsibility approach a shot. Maybe I'll love it, or maybe I'll land on something in the middle, but either way it's worth a go.

10-23-16 - Reading programming books always feels almost like cheating, since I just sit here as delicious information is fed to me. I'm happy to be able to devote some time after the immersive course to just reading and shoring up my knowlege base. The book on design patterns in particular really helped with my understanding of object oriented design.
