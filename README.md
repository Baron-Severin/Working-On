Commentary:  
11-1-16 - Finished Grokking Algorithms. A lot of the content was reasonably low level, but I'll admit that it helped me understand a few concepts that had previously gone over my head. Very clear explanations, I was impressed by the authors ability to break down concepts.  

10-29-16 - I've started a book called Grokking Algorithms. It has a very clear manner of explaining concepts, but the target audience is a little below where I'm at. I'm definitely going to be recommending it to some friends, but I wind up skimming past a lot of unnecessary detail about basic stuff. Still, there's good stuff in there. And it's written in Python, so I'm learning some syntax for things I otherwise could have only implemented in Java. I am really looking forward to getting back into Python, but I have so much to learn before I can afford to.  

10-27-16 - Finished Clean Code. There's a lot of great advice in that book, I can see why it's so universally recommended. Data Structures is more of a mixed bag. I'm seeing a lot of great concepts that I'm happy to be exposed to, but the descriptions definitely lack depth. I'm probably going to skim the rest of it, and supplement with another book on the same topic.

10-24-16 - On one hand, the proscriptions in Clean Code regarding class length feel a little dogmatic to me, but on the other my tendency has definitely been to write my classes to be overly large. I think I'll give the hyper-short, single responsibility approach a shot. Maybe I'll love it, or maybe I'll land on something in the middle, but either way it's worth a go.  

10-23-16 - Reading programming books always feels almost like cheating, since I just sit here as delicious information is fed to me. I'm happy to be able to devote some time after the immersive course to just reading and shoring up my knowlege base. The book on design patterns in particular really helped with my understanding of object oriented design.
